====== 1. First Program ======
Created Thursday 17 October 2019

Any program needs a start block. It is the **main(){** function in C++. The end is **}**.
Printing is one of the most fundamental thing in coding. Rather making basic abstractions like print, scan, we will use some standard things, like **cout**.
* cout <<_output, means that we are pushing the output into cout. So, it is called the insertion operator. For using the cout, we need a file called iostream.
* namespaces are used because different classes in the same program may have functions which are named the same. Hence we use the namespace to indicate the class from which we are using the class.	http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/
* Variables and data types, input output using std:cout and std:cin.
