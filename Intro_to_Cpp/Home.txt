=== Why learn C++ ===
Except that C++ is fast😅️, it helps in learning about:
1. Free-flow syntax - used in other langs like JS, Java, Go, C#, PHP
2. Simplest scoping rules.
3. Concept of data types, static typing.
4. Manipulate data directly at the bit level.
5. Pointers and memory management.
6. Multiple paradigms together:
	a. Structured programming - write like C. Use functions and pointers only.
	b. OOP:
Operator overloading(make your own operators from scratch)
Strict encapsulation - constrained access to object's members
7. Preprocessor
8. Compiler and Linker

Note: 
* These concepts are used in almost all languages - in some way or the other. So you'll be comfortable with new langs very quickly.
* Many languages can be seen as an abstraction over C++, so it helps in understanding their features better. Javascipt, Go, Java. You'll have a good foundation to reason about langs like C++.
* Important: Using C++ for learning other langs is not always beneficial or even possible - every language has its philosophy, style and quirks. Langs like Haskell, Lisp are completely different. Plus, it is boring to use the same style, philosophy.

=== C++ is used for ===
Writing very efficient code - time and memory wise. So, it is mostly used for implementing tools and libraries.
* Competitive programming - nothing personal.
* System software - operating systems, database engines, critical parts of a backend
* Game Development and graphics tools - Unreal engine, Unity
* Game development in general
* Writing interpreters for other langs - V8
* AI/ML/BigData libraries and tools - Tensorflow, PyTorch
=== C++ is not used for ===
Higher level stuff.
* Data science/AI/ML
* Web Development
* Mobile Development
* Scripting

=== Issues ===
* Learning C++ can //seem// boring, because it's not useful for higher level stuff - images, videos, websites. You can't //see// progress.
* Rapid prototyping is not a feature. However, there exists a Jupyter REPL for C++.
* It takes time to learn, the syntax //is// cryptic. But not complicated.
