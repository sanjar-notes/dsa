====== 3. Patterns ======
Created Friday 18 October 2019

**One of the most important topics.**
These are **simple** things, but they require clarity in the for and while loops.
The best approach is the one Nidhi Agarwal already taught.
How to solve a problem?
A:
1. Analyze the problem.
2. Break down the problem into smaller problems/steps.
3. Write down the solution on paper.
4. Verify the solution, using random examples. If we get stuck change the solution. 
5. Write code, this is just a formality.
--------------------
* As we print line by line, we need a loop to traverse the lines. Just write a blank while loop for this, for most problems. Now we just have to concentrate on the current line. Use **i for the row counter, and j for the column counter.**
* For keeping track of column, use another variable.
* We need to observe things mathematically or geometrically, or by using grids, get the hard values, then write the loops.
* Guess the number, then check the 1st and last and an intermediate case. **Done. Proof: mathematical induction.**
* Don't think of the number of variables used.
