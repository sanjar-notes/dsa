====== 4. Arrays as function parameters ======
Created Wednesday 13 November 2019

Declaring and defining the variables in the same statement:
1. data_type arr_name[] = { val1, val 2,...};  // creates an array of size = number of values n braces
2. data_type arr_name[arr_size] = { val1, val 2,...val n};  // creates an array of size arr_size(assuming no. of values <= arr_size). Also the first n elements of the arrays are initialized to val1 val2 .. val n. An the **remaining are initialized to 0. Remember this.**
* To create an array with all zeros just write, . data_type arr_name[arr_size] = {} 
* When we pass the array as argument, the whole array should be copied due to //Call by Value, //**But, **this does not happen because only the head is copied, the who array **is not copied.** 
Q) Reversing an array. Swap n/2(floored) times. On Both sides
A) for(int i=0, j=n-1, a = 1; a<=n/2; a++, i++, j--)
	{
		int temp = arr[i];
		ar[i] = arr[j];
		arr[j] = arr[i];
	} 
 
* In C++, it is **syntactically correct** to exceed the valid range of indices for an array. This can create problems, since accessing out-of-range elements do not cause errors on compilation, but can cause errors on runtime. The reason for this being allowed will be seen in a later chapter when pointers are introduced.
