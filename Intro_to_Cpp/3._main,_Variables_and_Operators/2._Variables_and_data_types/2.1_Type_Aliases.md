# 2.1 Type Aliases
Created Monday 18 May 2020

There are two ways to create type aliases:

1. **typedef**

	typedef int powder;	// alias at last


2. **using **keyword

	using powder = int; // # alias at the proper place, like a declaration

Both are equivalent, **using** is more intuitive;
Note: 

1. Remember that for pointers aliases(i.e the aliases for pointer type, apply for all the variables in a list declaration) - **This is pretty intuitive (HOW IT should have been).**

	using pint = int*;
	pint a, b, c; // same as int*a; int*b; int*c;
	/*
		int* a, b , c; // Wrong interpretation
	*/
		 


2. Replacing does not always, work - i.e semantics matter. **Beware **of** const**

	typedef char *pstring;
	const pstring x = 0; // cstr is a constant pointer to char
	
	// direct replacement
	const char * x; // wrong here
	
	char const * p; // correct - we want to make the alias as a constant
