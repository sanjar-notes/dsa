====== 1. Intro to flowcharts ======
Created Wednesday 16 October 2019

**What is a flowchart?**
* Diagrammatic representation illustrating the solution to a given problem.
* Allows you to break down any process into smaller steps and display them in a visually pleasing way.
**Advantages of flowcharts?**
* Helps in communicating the solution to someone who uses a different programming language/ technology.
* Maintainer's purpose, i.e for //design docs, //for preserving the logic of the program, for a later time.
--------------------
**Flowchart components:**
There are **6** flowchart components:
* **Terminator**: Indicates the Start and End of the flowchart.
* **Input/Output: **Used for reading and printing.
* **Process: **Represents a process, like assignment or other operation(s).
* **Decision: **Returns either True or False. One of the vertex is used for showing what happens when it is evaluated to be true, another vertex for false. The fourth vertex for re-entry.
* **Arrow:** Shows where to go next.
* **Connector: ** Used when function calls are involved. 
*Start and End are both Terminator components of the flowchart.
**Shapes of the components:**
