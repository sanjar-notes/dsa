# 2. Game of Nim
Created Sunday 02 August 2020


* Rule - Any player can remove any number of stones from a pile.
* Loser - The first person who has no stones to remove loses.



* Nimsum = XOR of all the stones in the piles, e.g 3 ^ 4 ^ 5.


Theorem of Nim:
	if(nimsum==0)
		player 1 loses;
	else
		player 1 wins;
	// assuming both are playing optimally
