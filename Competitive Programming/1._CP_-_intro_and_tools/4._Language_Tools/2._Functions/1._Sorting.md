# 1. Sorting
Created Sunday 03 May 2020

std::sort(ds.begin(), ds.end())
	int arr[] = {1,3,4,23,4,4};
	sort(arr, arr+len);


0. Library is ``<algorithm>``
1. Requires begin and end iterator.
2. For array: ``sort``(arr_head, arr_head+length).
3. For reverse, pass the functor ``greater<int>``, i.e greater is okay. Decreasing order.
4. Sorting on the basis of some object. Custom, write a custom function. Just overload the function(). We'll write our own comparator. Pass in a lambda.
	1. Sorting automatically calls the function and passes the elements(by value or reference).
	2. We just need to pass in the name or lamda.
	3. [ captures ] (parameters) -> returnTypesDeclaration { lambdaStatements; }
