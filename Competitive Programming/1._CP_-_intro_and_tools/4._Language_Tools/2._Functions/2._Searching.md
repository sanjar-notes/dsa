# 2. Searching
Created Sunday 03 May 2020


1. For sorted arrays, do **binary_search**(begin_it, end_it, key) - returns true if found, else false.
2. Find the index of the key, we use **lower_bound**(arr, arr+l, key) - returns the iterator if found. Iterator is arr.end() if not found. **Search from left side.**
	1. For finding the index as integer, do ``lower_bound() - arr.begin()``
	2. ``lower_bound`` - first element that is greater or equal.
		1. If key > maximum, then .end() is returned.
		2. If key exists, iterator to first occurrence of is returned.
	3. ``higher_bound`` returns the iterator to an element > key.
		1. If key is the last, returns ``.end()``

Note: The names are correct and to the point.

3. **equal_range(**begin_it, end_it, key**) **returns a pair of iterators to the first and the last item equal to the key. This can be used to get the number of repeated key values. **It is used for getting the first iterator to a key(even if there's just one key)**

	vector<int> A;
	int key;
	equal_range(A.begin(), A.end(), key).first; // iterator to first instance of key
	


4. For **linear search** - use **find(**begin_it, end_it, key**)** - returns the iterator to the first instance.


* Use a lambda comparator for decreasing values.
