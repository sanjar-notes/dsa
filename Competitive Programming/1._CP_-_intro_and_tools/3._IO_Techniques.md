# 3. IO Techniques
Created Thursday 23 April 2020

Simple prerequisites like loops and all.
In C++, we can read and write from a file using stdin and stdout.


* Always use <bits/stdc++.h> for competitive programming.
* File Handling

	freopen("in.txt", "r", stdin);	// read mode
	freopen("out.txt", "w", stdout); // there's the append mode "a" too
	
	cin >> x; // writes to x from stdin, i.e the file
	cout << x; // writes the value of x to the file


* You can output simutaneously to multiple output files, but input is taken from one stream only.

For Python:
	# Below is Python3 code for input/output
	
	import sys
	# For getting input from in.txt file
	sys.stdin = open('in.txt', 'r')
	x = input()	# reading
	
	# Printing the Output to out.txt file
	sys.stdout = open('out.txt', 'w')
	print(x)	//writing
