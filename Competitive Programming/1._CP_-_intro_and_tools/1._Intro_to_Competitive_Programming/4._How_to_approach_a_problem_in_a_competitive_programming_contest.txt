* This approach is the best for competitive programming, follow it.

**Problem**
1. Paragraphs
2. Input Format
3. Output Format
4. Constraints
5. Sample I/O
6. Explanation(of I/O) - Optional

The Approach:
1. **Read** the problem and understand it. We may need to read it many many times.
2. **Analyse** the requirements - What we need to do with allowed time limit.
3. Think of **solution(s) **with** Time Complexities.**
4. Choose a solution satisfying the **constraint**(s).
5. Write **pseudocode** or fix the solution steps.
6. **Dry Run** it once for sample cases. 
7. Check the I/O format, write **code**.
8. Check if All sample cases are **okay**. If not, go to Step 4.
9. Submit.

* We'll get the hang of it upon practicing.
