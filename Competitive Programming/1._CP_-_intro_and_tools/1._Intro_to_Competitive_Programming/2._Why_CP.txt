Created Thursday 23 April 2020

We are doing competitive programming to:
1. Enhance our coding and algorithmic skills.
2. It's an opportunity.
3. To get comfortable with logic and programming.
4. It makes our profile in the world, as a programmer.
5. To have fun.
6. Makes us fast and accurate.
7. Get a feel for practical programming.
8. Remove the fear of problems/algorithms design/logic.
 9. Guaranteed brain exercise.
10. Teaches us to work in teams.
11. It's actually fun. Competition all around the world.

We are not doing it:
1. For the sake of doing it.
2. For just doing it.
