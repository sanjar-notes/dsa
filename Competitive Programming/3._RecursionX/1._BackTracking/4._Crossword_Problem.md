*****


* There's no choice but to check all possible cases. This is a backtracking problem.
* We can calculate the starting coordinates, type(across or down) and length of the missing letters.
* Then we'll try to place them one by one.
* We have to also take into account that multiple words can cross each other. An intersection must be the same letter.
