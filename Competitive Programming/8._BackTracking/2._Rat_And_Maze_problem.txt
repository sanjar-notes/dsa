====== 2. Rat And Maze problem ======
Created Thursday 25 June 2020

A rat has to travel between the top-left and the bottom right in a //square grid//. The maze has two types of places, normal floor(1) and holes(0).  Find and print the number of ways it can do this, given the following contraints:
1. Holes are to be avoided.
2. Direction of movement from a cell can only be Left, Right, Up, Down.
3. We cannot pass through the walls.

* This is typical backtracking problem.
* Recursion will help us maintain current state.
--------------------
Code:
* We need to keep a path matrix - We use this for printing the way.
* It is also used to keep track of the path.
* We place 0 for the unvisited places and 1 for the visited places.
* This **path matrix** is different from the **maze **matrix.`
