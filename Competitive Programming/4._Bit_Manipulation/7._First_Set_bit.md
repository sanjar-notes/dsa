# 7. First Set bit
Created Tuesday 30 June 2020


* Find the first set bit and return it with the LSB's

e.g 101010**1**00 ⇒ **1**00

We don't now where the first 1 is, do manips, and we don't
	n =    101010100
	n-1;// 101010011 // useless
	-n; // 010101101
	n & -n


* n & n-1


*****

Turn off first set bit
	n =    101010100
	n-1;// 101010011 
	n & (n-1);// nothing was affected on the left
