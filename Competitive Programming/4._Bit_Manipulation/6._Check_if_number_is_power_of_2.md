# 6. Check if number is power of 2
Created Monday 29 June 2020

A number which is a power of 2 is of the form:
	000...1...000;// 1 is at the ith bit(unknown)

Solutions:

1. While Loop - Divide by 2 if possible, if we reach 1 return true ⇒ O(logn)
2. Count number of 1's in the binary representation ⇒ O(1) ⇒ 32 or 64 steps - Clumsy needs a for loop
3. return (n & (n-1))==0


*****

Inspiration - Observing that a power of 2 has all 0's except one, and n-1 of that has all 1's but just before the 1 in n ⇒ (n& n-1) = 0 for powers of 2. Then checking if the reverse is true. No counter example found, so tried to prove that it works only for powers of 2.
**isPower of 2 theorem**
**To prove: **n is power of 2 ⇔ n&(n-1) is 0

1. If n is a power of 2 ⇒ n&(n-1) is 0

n     = 0...**1**0...0
n-1 = 0...**0**1...1
n & n-1 = 0...0 
Proved

2. If n&(n-1) is 0 ⇒ n is a power of 2

If n is odd:
n      = 0...edcba1
n - 1= 0...edcba0
ans = n & (n-1) = 0...edbca0 ∵ x & x = x
ans = 0 iff all edcba are 0 ⇒ only n=1 is the odd power of 2. And the theorem **works**.
If n is even(with more than 1 ones):
Case 1: only 1 one
By definition correct, works.
Case 2:  Aleast two ones
n = 0...0edcba0...0 where there are atleast 2 ones. 1 ones are alread
Suppose a is the first one
n-1 = 0...0edcb01...1
n & n-1 =  0...0edcba0...0
  0...0edcb01...1
=   0...0edcb0000
!=0 because there's at least a 1
Doesn't work on any even numbers which is not a square
Proved
Q.E.D

* For situations where the i is unknown, do manipulations like -1, +1, *-1. Compare with n.
