====== 1. Intro to Game Theory ======
Created Sunday 02 August 2020

* Generally two players are playing the game.
* We need to predict the winner.
* We use basic maths here.
* We are studying combinatorial game theory - a game that ends. e.g Chess can be brought to a loop.
* There are two types of games:
	1. Impartial Games - both are playing similar things.
	2. Partisan Games - Both players have different moves available to them.
* We are focusing more for impartial games.
