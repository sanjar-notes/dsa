There are 3 notebooks:
1. **Introduction to C++** - For beginners
2. **Data Structures with C++** - covers basic algorithms also - search, sort
3. **Competitive Programming tips** - C++ is used

To open a notebook, run the `notebook.zim` file with [zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/).

These notes were created while doing a course from CodingNinjas.com.
I've added many more topics since.
