====== 4. Bit Manipulation ======
Created Monday 22 June 2020

* We've worked with int and float. But never considered using the property of binary digits.
* Bit manipulation is a very elegant and optimized way of solving problems.
* Bit operation are O(1)
* Bit manip has **many** applications in competitive programming.
Where is Bit manip used:
1. Competitive Programming
2. Data Compression

Note: Everything happens in standard notation(2's complement form)
Operator precedence:
1. Complement (~)
2. Shift operators (<<) and (>>)
3. Bitwise manip(^, &, |)
--------------------
Difference between logical and bitwise ops:
1. Bitwise ops don't short circuit, logical do.
2. XOR operator is absent for logical ops.
--------------------
Approach:
1. Choose the operator.
2. Find the mask. Consider 2^i when i is given. Else use +1, -1, *-1
3. Make the mask using the least ops.
4. Apply the mask.
