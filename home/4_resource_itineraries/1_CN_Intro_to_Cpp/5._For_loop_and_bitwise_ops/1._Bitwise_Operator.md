# 1. Bitwise Operator
Created Saturday 19 October 2019


* & - check even or odd →  do k&1 → if answer is 1, then k is odd. Otherwise even. 
* | checking for zero, do k | 0. If 0 comes, k is 0. else it is non-zero.
* ~ checking for 0, if the number after ~k == 0, then k is 0.
* ^ shortcut for checking equality, 0 if equal and 1 if unequal.

There are two bitwise shift operators:

* << operator. Shift to the left, pad with zeros.This does doubles the value for almost all numbers, except the ones with the second last MSB as 1 or 0, It flips the here. 
* >> **floored** **division with not truncation of decimal**. Padding with 0 or 1 as per compiler, g++17 pads negatives with 1 and, positives with 0. e.g -23/2 = -12
* Using shift operators with negative integers is termed an **undefined** operator coz we cannot predict the output for all cases.
