# 5. Scope of variables
Created Tuesday 22 October 2019


* C++ has an availability scope for each variable.
* Only one variable can be accessible by a name, anytime anywhere.

The following cases show all possible outcomes of a scope error:

1. Variable are accessible only within their nearest container codeblock.
2. init Variable in **for** loop are **in scope** inside the braces. Similarly for **while**, **switch **statements.
3. Overriding of value: if a variable in declared in the **same** scope, then this is an invalid practice.
4. Overriding of value: if a variable is declared in an **inner **scope, with the same name as a variable from an **outer **scope, then the outer variable is lost, i.e the **inner **one shadows the **outer **one.
