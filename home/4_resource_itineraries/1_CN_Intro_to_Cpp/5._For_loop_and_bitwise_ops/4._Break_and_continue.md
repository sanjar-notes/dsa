# 4. Break and continue
Created Tuesday 22 October 2019

Break and  continue are used to alter the normal flow of the **for, while **loops and the **switch statement**.
**break: ** This exits only the innermost loop where we are currently in. 
loop1{int a
loop2{ int b
break;
loop3{int a
}
}
}

the break here will not let loop3 execute for any iteration of loop2. 
No.of times run = a*b
**continue**:
This will skip execution of the code below **continue** and take the nearest current to the next iteration. 

* Be  sure to do the increment step when using the continue statement in a **while** loop. In the for loop this is not required. Because increment statement is executed **even if** continue is used.
