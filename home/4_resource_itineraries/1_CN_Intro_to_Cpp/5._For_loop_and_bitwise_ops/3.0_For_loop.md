# 3.0 For loop

Created Tuesday 22 October 2019
structure of a for loop:
init variable(s)
while(check_condition){

---

---

---

incerement/decrement;
}

structure for the for loop:
for(init; condition_check; increment){

---

---

---

}
for and while are exactly the same, except jargon.

Advantages of a for loop:

1. We tend to forget the increment condition, this helps in avoiding the mistake.
2. It makes the code neater.

Important:

1. All the three parts of the for are optional, we can skip one or more of them. But the three semicolons are **compulsory. **<http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/control/>
2. In the initialization, we can initialize multiple variables, separated by commas. It's(first expression's) value does not matter anyway.
3. In the check_condition, all boolean expressions have to be connected using bool operators only, no commas should be used.
4. the increment part can have multiple increment parts separated by commas.

Running time:

- the inititializer is run only 1 time
- the checker is run n times, this including the anchor/stopping condition.
- the incrementer runs n times, including the last increment.

State:
The start state is the initializer.
The end state is the checker or a break inside the body.

**A hard lesson: The order of content in a loop does matter. **
