# 3. Loops

Created Wednesday 16 October 2019

When we have to do a thing for some known number of times or until an event occurs, we use the concept of loop.
Basically, we just take the arrow to a previously executed component.

e.g print all numbers from 1 to N. Assume N>=1.
How will a human do this, he'll start counting from 1 and then writing all numbers, while checking if currentNum<=N.
**This is exactly what a computer does.**

In terms of a flowchart, this happens:

P2: Print all the even number between 1 and N (both inclusive)
