# 2. Why learn C++
Created Sunday 07 November 2021

#### Why learn C++?

* It's really useful across all domains (parts of it).
* It's a language with lot of features. Therefore:
	* Learn different paradigms of programming.
	* Learn about low level (near hardware) stuff.
	* Learn about data structures and how they are implemented.
* Other languages are made for doing specific stuff, but C++ offers every kind of abstraction, from low level stuff to very abstract features.
