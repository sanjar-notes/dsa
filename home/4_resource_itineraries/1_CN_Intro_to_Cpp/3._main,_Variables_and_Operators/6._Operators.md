# 6. Operators
Created Friday 18 October 2019


* int/int gives an int, not a float.
* any operation using a float/double gives a float/double.
* Remember, = is also an operator just like =,-,* etc. if we write (a=2) where 'a' has been previously been defined/declared, then assignment occurs, and then the left hand value is the result of the expression, which is two in this case.

Types of operators:

* **Arithmetic operator:**
	* +
	* -
	* *
	* /
	* % can be used only when both operands are int.
* **Relational operator:**
	* ==
	* !=
	* <
	* >
	* <=
	* >=
* **Logical operator:**
	* &&
	* ||
	* !
	* there's no logical XOR in C++. We can do bitwise to achieve the same.
