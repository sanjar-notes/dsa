# 2. Isosceles Triangle
Created Saturday 19 October 2019

Very interesting.
Insights: Here each row has three phases:

1. The spaces. (_). Make a variable called space. Keep space and j as counters as far as possible. No need to foolishly mathematicize.
2. Increasing numbers. Avoid writing ++ or â€” directly in cout.	
3. Decreasing numbers.

e.g (ignore the spaces between underscore) 
_ _ 1 _ _
_ 1 2 1 _
1 2 3 2 1
Solution: Let's write code for this first,
_ _ 1
_ 1 2
1 2 3
Then we'll se about the decreasing thing in each row.
Conclusion: Try to keep things as independent as you can between the phases, saved time in debugging.
**Analogies are ***too*** important to be ignored, what you already know to do is very important too.** **That's it. Good confidence increased.**
