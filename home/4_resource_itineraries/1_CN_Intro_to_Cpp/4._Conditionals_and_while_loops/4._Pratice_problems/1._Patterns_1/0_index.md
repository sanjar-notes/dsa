# 1. Patterns 1
Created Friday 18 October 2019

How to make a pattern?
A: Before writing the code, we must know these:

1. Number of rows to be printed, **i.**
2. How many things/columns in the **i'**th row. f(i)
3. What to print the in the  ith row, i.e what to be printed at (i, j). This can depend on **i **or** j **or **N. Guess it, you need to be clear about the dependencies.**

**This is all that matters for patterns. It is best to initialize i and j by 1, not 0. Do not initialize j in terms of i, if you can help it.**
