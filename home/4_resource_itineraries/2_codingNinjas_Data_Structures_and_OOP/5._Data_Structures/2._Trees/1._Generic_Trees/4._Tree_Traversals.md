# 4. Tree Traversals
Created Wednesday 29 January 2020

We have already done these

1. Print basic, print root, then print left subtree and then the other subtrees.  - **PreOrder (NLR)**
2. Level wise, using queue - **LevelOrder **(Independent).


Trees are having simple problems mostly. Recursion is the primary weapon.


3. inOrder traversals: Print the left(immediate i.e at(0)) subtree, print the root, print the other subtrees. **abdul bari sir's method is not useful.**
4. postOrder traversals: Print all the subtrees then print the root.



* **left right is a bad terminology for trees, children number is better. We will use elder of children which come first, i.e towards left in the vector.**
