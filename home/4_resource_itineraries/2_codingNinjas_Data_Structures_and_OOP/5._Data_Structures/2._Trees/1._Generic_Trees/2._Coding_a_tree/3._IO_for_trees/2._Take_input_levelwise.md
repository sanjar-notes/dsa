# 2. Take input levelwise
Created Monday 27 January 2020


* takeInput() was difficult to use, the user had to know recursion to use it. 
* Asking by generation.
* **Very very easy.**

code:
template <typename T>
TreeNode<T> *levelwise_Input()
{
//make the root
cout << "Data for root node: ";
int data;
cin >> data;

TreeNode<T> *root = new TreeNode<T>(data);

queue<TreeNode<T> *> nodesPending;
nodesPending.push(root); // obviously pending

while (nodesPending.size() != 0)
{
data = nodesPending.front()->data; // cureent root's data
cout << "Number of children for " << data << " : ";
int n;
cin >> n;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
cout << "Data for " << data << "'s " << i << "th child: ";
TreeNode<T> *child = new TreeNode<T>;
cin >> child->data;
nodesPending.front()->children.push_back(child);
nodesPending.push(child);
}
nodesPending.pop();
}
return root;
// When you are a leaf
/*
Insights: Takes in a BFS way, is an implicit queue.
Easy to use.
Maid: Do things in the order of arrival, queue
Description:
Goes to a node, takes all data for its children.
Then starts from the first child. When that is over goes to the second child. Ans so on.
