# 2. Height of a tree Exercise
Created Monday 27 January 2020


* Concept: Height is just the maximum number of levels in the tree.



* **We can say a single node is height 0 and also height 1. Definition is ***flexible***. There's no convention here.**
* If we want to avoid negative numbers, we will be saying a **single node** is height **1**. As we will return 0 for NULL.
