# 3. Iterators - C++ Feature
Created Tuesday 18 February 2020


* Traversing containers requires container.

 They are useful for vector, list, map, set, unordered_map, unordered_set.

Info about STL:

* set is nothing but a map with no values. Hence duplicate keys don't have a meaning. map has a pair. No difference as such.
* unordered_map works similar to unordered_set. O(1) ops. hash table.
* set works similar to map. Both are ordered and implemented using BST. O(logn) ops.



* Iterators are multi-purpose. They can be used for deleting as well as traversing.
* Also iterators have container dependent implementations.


*****


* The way to think of an iterator
* An iterator is like a pointer to the data element. i.e -> and * should be used.
* **syntax:** container_type : : iterator iterator_name; 
* We advance forward using iterator_name+=1; i.e adding **integers** is allowed.
* container_name.begin() returns iterator to the first element.
* container_name.end() returns the iterator __after__ the last element.


*****

Many functions in STL deal with iterators.

1. find(value), returns iterator to the first found element.
2. erase(value_) or erase(start_iter, ending_iter) - does not make much sense for unordered map. Useful for list, vector.
