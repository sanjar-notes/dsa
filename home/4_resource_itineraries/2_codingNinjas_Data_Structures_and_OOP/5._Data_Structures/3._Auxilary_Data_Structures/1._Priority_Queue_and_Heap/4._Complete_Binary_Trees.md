# 4. Complete Binary Trees
Created Friday 14 February 2020


* CBT is always balanced. So one overhead of BST is resolved. 
* The CBT is stored in an array, i.e heap is a virtual tree. Consequently, children can be reached like so:
	* leftChild is at 2*i+1
	* rightChild is at 2*i+2

**Proof - why 2i+1, 2i+2**
Suppose that we are a node, now:

* Number of nodes before this node = i in array and 2^h-1^-1 in the tree
* Number of nodes in this level = 2^h-1^ in tree
* index of Left child of the node = number of nodes before it = before + this_level = 2^h-1^-1 + 2^h-1^=2*i+1 ; because i = 2^h-1^-1;
* Similarly, right child = left child+1 = 2*i+2


Using induction,
Base step: For the root, left  = 2*0+1 = 1; right = 2*0+2 = 2.
Hypothesis step: This is true for any node: left = 2*i+1, right = 2*i+2
Inductive step: For the second node, we have left = 2*i+2+1 = 2*(i+1)+1, right = left +1 = 2*(i+1)+2
And so on for all, until we reach the first of another level.

Proved by induction.

*****

We now know how to calculate indices for the left and right child. We also need a way to know the parent, because this is used in **deletion**, the formula is simple.
p = (c - 1)//2
Note: We are truncating decimals here, which is the norm in C++.

*****

We store data in an array for fast accesses, i.e O(1) access as well as fast insert and update.
