# 7. In-place heap
Created Saturday 15 February 2020


* We need to convert an array into a heap.
* To start, visualize like this:
	1. The first element is a heap.
	2. We insert the a new element at the end o fthe array. Which it is, naturally.
	3. Here we sift the newly inserted element up. Till the heap property is satisfied.
	4. Eventually, we have a heap.

T.C for this operation:  


* We have a heap. To sort the elements, do this.
	1. removeMIn(). We swap the end of the heap and the root, i.e index 0.
	2. We sift the index 0 element down, until the heap order property is satisfied. Which will happen eventually.
	3. continue till we all the elements are over.



* We have the sorted array in decreasing(non-increasing) order.



* minHeap is used for reverse sort.
* max heap for sorting.
