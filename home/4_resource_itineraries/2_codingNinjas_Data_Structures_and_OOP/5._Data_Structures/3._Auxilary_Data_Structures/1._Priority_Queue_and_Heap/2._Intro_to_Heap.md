# 2. Intro to Heap
Created Friday 14 February 2020

BST has the following disadvantages:

1. Balancing factor, we have to check if it is balanced, after every insertion/deletion.
2. Storing is difficult, i.e nodes->data + nodes*pointers, i.e as Binary Tree. Too much size requirement.


So we make a new data structure - called heap.

*****

A heap must satisify 2 properties at all times:

1. **Complete Binary Tree **property -  it has 2^h^-1 spaces. Complete - all levels are filled completely, except the last one(although it must be filled from left to right).
2. **Heap order **property - all nodes must be greater than their children, in case of a max-heap and smaller than their children for a min-heap.



* Purpose of the CBT property - maintains a nearly balanced tree at height lg(n).
* Purpose of the heap order property - maintains max/min at the root node.
