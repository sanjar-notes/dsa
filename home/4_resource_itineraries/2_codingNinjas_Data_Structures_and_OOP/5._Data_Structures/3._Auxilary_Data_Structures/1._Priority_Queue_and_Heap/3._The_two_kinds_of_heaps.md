# 3. The two kinds of heaps
Created Thursday 08 April 2021

#### Kinds of heaps
We have two kinds of priority queues: i.e min-heap and max-heap. 

* min heap: pops out the minimum when asked.
* max heap: pops out the maxiumum when asked.


Heap order property: The parent is **smaller** than its children. MinHeap. The parent is **greater** than its children. MaxHeap.


* Remember, this is not a BST. So we care only for the parent and children.
* BST cares about left and right, while heap cares only one direction, down.
