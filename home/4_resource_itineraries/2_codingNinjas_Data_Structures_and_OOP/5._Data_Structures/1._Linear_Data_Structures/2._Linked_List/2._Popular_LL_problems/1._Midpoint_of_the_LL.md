# 1. Midpoint of the LL
Created Saturday 18 January 2020

Remember the middle element is floor((length-1)/2)


* For uni or empty return head.
* Make two pointers travx and trav2x. Both initialized as head.
* while(travx->next!=NULL and trav2x->next->next!=NULL)	// no other way, we will miss the even case.

travx = travx -> next;
trav2x = trav2x -> next -> next;
// we don't need to check the case where trav2x == NULL, i.e we have never made that move.
	

* When the loop ends. We are at the list of the first element. Stop operations.
	1. For odd sized list. We are at the middle element;
	2. For even size. We are at the element that is.

**Length is not necessary to be calculated for getting the middle element.**
