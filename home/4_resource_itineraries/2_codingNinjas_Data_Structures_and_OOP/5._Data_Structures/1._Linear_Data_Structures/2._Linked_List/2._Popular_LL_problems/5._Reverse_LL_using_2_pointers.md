# 5. Reverse LL using 2 pointers
Created Saturday 18 January 2020


* Method in no.4 can be made o(n) by storing the last pointer, rather than finding it every time.
* We create a public class which has two pointers, head and last. Which store head of the reversed linked lista and the last node's address.
* We return this class called 'Pair' using a helper function which takes in only the value head.
* **As shown in the video, as this is a skewed tree recursion, we can return the value without making a new value.**
