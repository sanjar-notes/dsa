# 4. Print LL in reverse
Created Saturday 18 January 2020


* If uni or empty, return;
* Solve using stack. Better use recursion. But we could also make an LL.


1. Iterative
	* Make a node pointer named phead
	* Traverse the original LL till head equals NULL. 
		* create a new node with data as (head). 
		* newnode->next = phead; // first one points to NULL, as it'll be the last.
		* phead = newnode, where we will point in the next iteration.
		* At the end, there would be no iteration. 
		* phead is the head of the reversed linked list(as in-place reversing was not allowed on the original list, otherwise we would have reversed it in the first place).
	* Traverse the reversedLL, create a to_be_deleted pointer.
		* to_be_deleted = phead;
		* phead = phead -> next;
		* cout << to_be_deleted << " ";
		* delete to_be_deleted.
2. Recursive solution:

if(head==NULL)
return;
f(head->next);
cout << head ->data;
