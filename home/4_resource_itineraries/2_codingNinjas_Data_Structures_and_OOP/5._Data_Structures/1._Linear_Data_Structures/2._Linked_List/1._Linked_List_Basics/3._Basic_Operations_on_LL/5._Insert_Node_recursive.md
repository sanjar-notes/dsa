# 7. Insert Node recursive
Created Friday 17 January 2020

Node* insertNodeRec(Node *head, int i, int data) 
{
if(head==NULL && i!=0)
return head;
if(i==0)
{
Node* newnode = new Node(data);
newnode->next  = head;
return newnode; // insertion at the beginning
}
    
head->next =  insertNodeRec(head->next, i-1, data); // traverses to the next element, makes a connection to the list which is present
return head;
}

**How does it work?**
A) We insert at the beginning only. This is the base case case and easy to check. Return the newnode's address.

* Another part of the base case is if head==NULL, but index!=0. Stop. Overrun. Return head.
* Recursion step: Here head!=null **and** index!=0 is true. 

head->next = the starting of the remaining list = f(head->next, data, index).

* It is important to remember that remaking this already connection, i.e a system's property helps us write the recursion without making a helper function. 
* Hence we don't have to use a helper function.

**New(?intuition) skill learnt !!**
