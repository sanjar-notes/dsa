Very good and informative.
Namespaces can be unioned.

Three ways:

1. Using explicit ::
2. using directive, everything is availble. i.e mapped.
3. using declartion, parts are available. i.e mapped.


Note: Member functions and data members don't need to be specified a namespace, as the object is already mapped. Remember two objects cannot have the same name. **But two namespace can have the same name, they are unioned, not overridden.**
