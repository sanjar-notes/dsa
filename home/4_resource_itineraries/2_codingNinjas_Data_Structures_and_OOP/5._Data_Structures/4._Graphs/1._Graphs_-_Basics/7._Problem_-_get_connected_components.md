# 7. Problem - get connected components
Created Tuesday 31 March 2020


1. Keep a bag for getting all nodes
2. Run DFS on the starting vertex. Pass the bag as visited for this. Keep filling the bag.
3. Do 2 and 3 for all unvisited nodes. Once done stop.
4. If visited.size()==V, return true; else return false;


Note: Here we can use two different bags too. But that's cumbersome. Not required.
