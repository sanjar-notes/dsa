# 2. Get Path
Created Tuesday 31 March 2020

Given A and B nodes.
Return the path from A to B, if it exists.

* Path may not necessarily be the shortest in our algorithm.


Two paths are possible:

1. DFS Path
2. BFS Path



1. DFS - quite simple, just return a vector of the paths traversed.
2. BFS - returns the **shortest path** - **Shortest path proof - property of BFS.** Just make a diagram.


* We just run BFS and stop if we find the key or the graph ends. While checking for key.
* We check if visited has the key. If it does, then we print it, then check it's predecessor(in the visited graph). We do this until we reach -1. Stop.

T.C same as BFS
S.C same as BFS (2n)
