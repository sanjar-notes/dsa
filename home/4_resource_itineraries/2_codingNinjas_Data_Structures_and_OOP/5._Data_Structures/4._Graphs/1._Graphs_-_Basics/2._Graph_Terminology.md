# 2. Graph Terminology
Created Monday 30 March 2020


1. Vertices - nodes are called vertices.
2. Edges - a line that connects two vertices.
3. Adjacent vertices - two vertices connected by a edge.
4. Degree - this is defined for a vertex = number of edges connected to a vertex(incoming is taken as +ve for outgoing, if graph is directed)
5. Path - An ordered set of edges from a vertex A to B.
6. Connected graph - If every vertex is reachable from every other vertex, then this graph is called a connected graph. Simply said, there are no disjoint groups.
7. Connected components - The groups of connected graphs in a given graph. For a connected graph, number of connected components is 1. For a non connected graph it is greater than one.

8. Cycle - A path which starts from a vertex and comes back to the same vertex. A cycles must have at least 2 distinct edges in its path.
9. Tree - a connected graph with no cycles.

**Range of edges, vertices and degree.**
Given a graph V, E.

* minimum number of edges = 0. All vertices are seperate. A fully disconnected graph.
* minimum number of edges in a connected graph = all are connected but uses the least edges to connect = no cycles at all = A **tree**(except the root, number of edge vertex pairs are n-1) = n-1
* maximum edges = **complete graph** = each edge is connected to every other edge = all posssible connections among all vertices = ^n^C~2~ = n(n-1)/2
