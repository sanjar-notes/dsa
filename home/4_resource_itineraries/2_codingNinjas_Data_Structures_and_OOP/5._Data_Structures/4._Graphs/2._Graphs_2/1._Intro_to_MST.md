#### **Minimum Spanning Tree**
``Tree``: A connected graph with no cycles.
``Spanning Tree``: Given a simple(no loops or multiedge) undirected connected graph, a tree containing all the vertices of the graph is called a spanning tree. 

* There can be multiple MSTs for a given graph.
* For a spanning tree: |N|-|E| = 1


**Minimum Spanning Tree: **For a weighted, connected and undirected graph, a minimum spanning tree(MST) is a tree with the least weight. **There could be multiple MST's for the same graph. **

**Remember the MST requirements for a given graph:**

1. **Weighted**
2. **Undirected**
3. **Connected**


Multiplicity of MST's for a given graph:
Experimentation shows that multiple trees can exist. **Remember** tree signatures are different. i.e Graph matrices should be different.
Uniqueness:
If each edge has a **distinct** weight then there will be only one, unique minimum spanning tree. 
**Simple proof. **For different trees, at least one edge is different. If two MST's were possible, then we need to have

Invariants and Properties:

1. Adding any edge to an MST creates a cycle.


*****

Finding MST for a given weighted, connected and undirected graph.

Naive Approach:

1. Find all the Spanning trees.
2. Find weight of each(i.e sum of edges)
3. Trees with minium values of weight are MSTs.
