# 1. Kruskal's Algo Complexity
Created Saturday 25 April 2020

#### Algorithm
Idea:

1. Sort the edges according to weights. **Adjacency list will be better here(as it'll store the weights).** 
2. Take the edges: source-destination-weight as input.
3. For storing the MST, make a list of n-1 <edges>.


**No visited bag required!**

Pseudocode:

1. Sort the edges according to weights. **Adjacency list will be better here(as it'll store the weights).** 
2. Take the edges: source-destination-weight as input.
3. For storing the MST, make a list of n-1 <edges>.


#### Analysis - Time and Space

* Time Complexity is O(VE) using union find.

* We can make it O(E logV) by using Union by rank and Path Compression, i.e we try to make a balanced tree.
