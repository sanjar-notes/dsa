# 6. Dijkstra's Algorithm
Created Sunday 26 April 2020

Given a graph, directed or undirected with weights. **Should not have NEGATIVE weights.**

* Trick for negatives: Add the most negative value(+ve) to all the weights. Solve using dijkstra, then subtract each edge by the negative value. 



* We find the shortest path from a start vertex to all of the other vertices.



* We have two lists: **visited** and **unvisited** vertices.


**Algorithm**:

1. Pick a vertex from the **unvisited **vertices with the **least distance** from the start. **These may be non-neighbours.**
2. Explore it, i.e update the distance value of a neighbour if distance(curr->neighbour) + distance(start->curr) < distance(start->neighbour). Also update it's parent(or predecessor). Do this for all the **unvisited neighbours**. We have confidence in our **greedy algo.  **Greedy Choice Property. (No reconsiderations)
3. After we have explored all the vertices, stop.
4. We can trace the path too.
5. Visual aid - A table with <visited, vertex, distance_from_start, parent> + is_visited_array.

Time Complexity is O(V^2^) - for adjacency matrix

* We can use an adjacency list, O(VE)
* We can use a priority queue for the minimum thing. O((V+E)*logV)
