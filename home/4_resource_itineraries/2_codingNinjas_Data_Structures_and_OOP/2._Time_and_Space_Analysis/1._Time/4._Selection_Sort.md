# 4. Selection Sort
Created Sunday 05 January 2020


* Find the optimum, place it at the optimum index of the sorted part.
* Does this for each. Takes size_unsorted for placing an element to it's sorted position.
* Time: n + n-1 + ... + 1 = O(n^2^). Worst case.
* Best case: list is already sorted. We still do  size_unsorted, to find the smallest. **Still** O(n^2^).

**Selection sort is the ***slower ***than insertion sort.**
