# 4. Exception Handling
Created Monday 27 April 2020

[Exception_Handling CN Official Notes](./4._Exception_Handling/Exception_Handling.pdf)


* Exception handling increases maintainability as it seperates errors/exception from intermingling with the logic. i.e error handling is done seperately.
* Error handling does not do implicit conversions.
* It's like a switch case.
* throw is like return.
* We can form a hierarchy of try throw and catch.
* try must contain throw inside, catch must be in the same scope as try.
* catch(...) should be placed last it is like a default case in switch.
* Every object inside the try is destroyed before going to catch, just like normal *return* in functions.
* We can define our own exceptions by inheriting from the exception class <exception> should be included.
* Everything created **inside** the catch block is destructed before going to the catch block, so we **cannot **access the value made inside the catch.
