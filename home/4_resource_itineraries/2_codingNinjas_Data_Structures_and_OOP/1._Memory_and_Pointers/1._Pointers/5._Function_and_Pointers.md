# 5. Function and Pointers
Created Monday 23 December 2019


* Re-emphasizing the scope of pointers. 
* (*p)++ is significant. 
* int x[] as a formal parameter is the same as int*. No difference at all. Hence we need to pass the length. 
* Passing parts of the function as an array, is a useful trick. 

f(arr+2, 5) is the same as making a pointer on the 3rd then passing it.
