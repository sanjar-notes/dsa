# 3. Quick Sort
Created Wednesday 01 January 2020

Step 1: Create two phases one either side, one with all elements less than or equal to the pivot.  Till both writing heads are equal. 
How?

* Count the number of elements less(strictly) than pivot_value
* swap(pivot, arr[n_smaller])
* initialize i = 0, j = size-1. 
	1. if(arr[i]<arr[n_smaller]) i++;
	2. if(arr[j]<=arr[n_smaller]) j--; // = here coz we need to be strict
	3. if(arr[i]>=arr[n_smaller] && arr[j] < arr[n_smaller]). swap(A[i], A[j]); i++, j--;
* As QS is a tail recursion. We call QS after the partition function.
	* Note that the n_smaller is a sorted position. Avoid it in the function call.
	* Call qs on all before n_smaller.
	* Call qs on all after n_smaller.
