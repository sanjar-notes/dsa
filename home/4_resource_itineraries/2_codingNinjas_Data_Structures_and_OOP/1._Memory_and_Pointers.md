# 1. Memory and Pointers
Created Thursday 08 April 2021

#### Note
The course had two small topics after "[Dynamic Memory Allocation](./1._Memory_and_Pointers/2._Dynamic_Memory_Allocation.md)":

1. [Macros and Global Variables](./7._C++_Continued/1._Macros_and_Global_Variables.md)
2. [Inline and Default Arguments](./7._C++_Continued/2._Inline_and_Default_Arguments.md)

I've moved them elsewhere. They are very important(and easy) in general, but are not required for coding data structures.
