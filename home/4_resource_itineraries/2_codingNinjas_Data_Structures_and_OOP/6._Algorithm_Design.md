* Algorithm design was not taught in the Coding Ninjas course, except for the [Dynamic Programming](./6._Algorithm_Design/3._Design_Techniques/3._Dynamic_Programming.md) section.
* If you are learning data structures for the first time, I advise you to should skip all subsections of this section, except Dynamic Programming, for *nowüëçÔ∏è.*
