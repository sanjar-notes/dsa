# 3. Unary pre
Created Saturday 11 January 2020

#### Important Questions

* How is return working in the memory for a function?
* If we overload ++, is it prefix or postfix?
* Unary vs binary vs ternary in OOP?


#### Unary
There are two possibilities
**Without Nesting**
```c++
void operator++()
{
  a++;
}
```

**With Nesting**
```c++
Number operator++()
{
	a++;
	return *this;
}
```

17. This is very interesting. If we try ++(++obj), value gets increased by 1 and not 2. Why?
18. System buffers are responsible for this
	* When we return an object, only it's value is returned. i.e Return by value is the norm. Hence any changes on the returned value will not cause a change in the original variable.This can be avoided by using pointers. But that'd be complex(when using the function). Instead, we set the return **type as reference**.
	* This is required in order to facilitate **nesting of operators. **We need to hold the value, until we are done working on it.
	* **Solution** - Return ``Number&``, i.e no extra buffer is created, an alias will be returned. This means that we are working on the same object.
