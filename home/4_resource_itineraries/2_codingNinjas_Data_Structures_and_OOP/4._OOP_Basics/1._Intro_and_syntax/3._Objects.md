# 3. Objects
Created Wednesday 08 January 2020

#### Syntax
```
class_name object_name; // this allocates memory. variable of type student in the stack.
class_name * object_name = new class_name; 	// this creates a pointer in stack to a memory location in heap.
```

* This is **exactly **like we do for in-built data types.
* Memory allocated for an object = sum of the memory of the attributes. **No meta data is stored in the objects, viz functions, static variables.**


**Q**) Can we create an object anywhere we like?
**A**) We can create anywhere after the class has been defined.

* To include classes from other files, use this syntax.
```
#include "absolute_path/class_file_name.extnsn" // different directory
#include "file.extnsn" // file in the current directory
```

* #include just copies text from the *class_file_name.extnsn *to the current file.

#### Accessing members of an object

* Variable
```c++
obj.name; // access 'name' attribute of 'obj' object
obj.fact() // call fact() function of 'obj'
// . is called the selector operator
```

* Pointer
```c++
(*p).name;
(*p).fact();

// C++  has a better way, a simple expression. Does exactly the same thing.
p->name;
p->fact();
```

#### **Concept of Access Specifier in C++**

* Access Specifiers are keywords associated with members(attributes, functions) which modify the level of access.
* They are applicable only outside the class, i.e they have no meaning inside the class.
* There are three: *public*, *private* and protected.

Syntax:
```c++
class A{
	public:
		int a;
		int b;
	private:
		void f();
};
```

* We can have multiple sections of the same specifier too.
```c++
class A{
	public:
		int a;
		int b;
	private:
		void f();
	public: //allowed
		int c;
};
```

**Notes:**
* When not specified, all things are **private** by default in a class.
```c++
class Car {
  int a; // a is private
};
```
* [The access modifiers work on class level, and not on object level](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4117002/why-can-i-access-private-variables-in-the-copy-constructor) i.e, two objects of the same class can access each others private data.
