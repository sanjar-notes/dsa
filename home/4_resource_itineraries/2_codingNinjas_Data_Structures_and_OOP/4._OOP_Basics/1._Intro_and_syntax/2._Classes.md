# 2. Classes
Created Thursday 08 April 2021

#### What is a class?
* Idea of a class - It is just a blueprint of our custom data type. It has the data(variables) and functions.
* Idea of an object - An **object** is an instance of a class, and **occupies** some memory. On the other hand, class is a blueprint, so it does not occupy any memory(except on the code-section, of course).

#### Syntax to create a class
```c++
class class_name
{
	data_type_1 attrib1;
	data_type_2 attrib2;
	// only declarations, we can even do int marks[], i.e data structures/ other classes are also allowed
};
```
