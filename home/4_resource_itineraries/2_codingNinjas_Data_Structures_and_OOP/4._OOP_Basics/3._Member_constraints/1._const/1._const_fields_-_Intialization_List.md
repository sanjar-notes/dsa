# 1. const fields - Intialization List
Created Saturday 11 January 2020


* How do we work with **const** data members?
If we don't initialize, then the value is stuck and will be the same for all objects.

* C++ does not allow initialization outside a function.

To solve this problem, we need to use **initialization lists.**

*****
**Syntax**
```c++
class A{
	int a, b;
	const string c;
	int d[4];
	...
	void f() : a(2), b(a), c("Sanjar"), d{1,2,3,4} // intialization list
	{
		...
	}
	...
};
```
* We can initialize any data member using i-lists
* It is the first thing that is run, when an object is being created.
* Variables in the i-list are not initialized in the order that they are specified in the i-list. Instead, they are initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class.
* Making a constructor(with initialization list) is a must if at least one data member is const or reference.
* We should not write 'this' in the initialization list, **except for a reference variable**. That would give an error. The names are not overshadowed here.

*****
**Use case:**
1. If we want a const data member.
2. If our class has reference data members.
(Both need to be declarized).

*****
* In C++11 and higher, we can initialize const and references just outside the constructor too.
* Even here, the initialization list is evaluated first.
