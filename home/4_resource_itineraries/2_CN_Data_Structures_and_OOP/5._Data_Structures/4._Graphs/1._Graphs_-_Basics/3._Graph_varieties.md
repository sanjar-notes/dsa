# 3. Graph varieties
Created Wednesday 01 April 2020


1. For directed graphs - We make a change only to edges[i][j] if i and j are neighbours(not on edges[j][i]).
2. For weighted graphs - Store the weight from a to b in edge[a][b].
3. For directed weighted - store weight in one direction. (i, j) only and not (j, i).
4. For self loop multipgraph and directed mixed. Store the loops with edges[i][i] as an integer. Multiple edges can also be stored, just store the number of edges.
5. For weighted multigraph, store the edge as a vector<int> of weights. Simple.



* All types of graphs and reprentations have been dealt with. **Easy.**
