# 3. Output level wise
Created Monday 27 January 2020

As we did in the take level part, use the queue STL. And do it.

code:
template <typename T>
void levelwise_printTree(TreeNode<int> *root)
{
//prank check
if (root == NULL)
return;

queue<TreeNode<int> *> nodesPending;

nodesPending.push(root); // obviously pending, we have not printed it's children.

// Another reason is that if we don't do this, then queue will not be systematic.

// for optimization
int data;                   // for relevance
int n;                      // number of children
TreeNode<int> *node = NULL; // the parent node

// start printing the children
while (nodesPending.size() != 0)
{
node = nodesPending.front(); // current root's data
n = node->children.size();
data = node->data;

if (n == 0)
cout << node->data << ": Leaf\n";
else
{
cout << "Children of " << data << ": ";
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
cout << node->children.at(i)->data << ", ";
nodesPending.push(node->children.at(i));
}
cout << "\b\b  \n";
}

nodesPending.pop();
}
}
