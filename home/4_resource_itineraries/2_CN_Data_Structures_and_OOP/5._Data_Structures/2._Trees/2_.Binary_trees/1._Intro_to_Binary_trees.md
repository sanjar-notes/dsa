# 1. Intro to Binary trees
Created Thursday 30 January 2020


* A special kind of tree, i.e each node has at most 2 children. i.e 0(leaf) 1 or 2.
* They are used in many scenarios. In interviews as well.



* How does it impact our TreeNode class?
	1. Children.capacity() <= 2. It is finite.
	2. Hence store them as 'left' and 'right' nodes addresses.
	3. vector is no longer a requirement.
* To avoid confusion, we have BinaryTreeNode

{
T data;
BinaryTreeNode<T>* left, right;
}

Note:
 1  and 1
/		    \
 2		     		2 are **different(bit by bit)** here. **They are the same even in generic trees. Order did matter there too.**

* The problem is that the skewed tree is different because the size of the child structure is fixed to 2. Hence two possibilities are present.



* We have created left and right due to restriction in the system, arbitarirness of left and right, this will be useful later.
