# 5. Palindrome Linked List
Created Saturday 18 January 2020


* For uni or empty, return true.
* Move to the first half.
* Check if odd or even. Move to the first node of the right side LL. 
* Start reversing from this part of the LL.
* Once done, traverse from head to NULL and for the reverse LL.
* Both the trav will now hit NULL at the same time, so checking any one is fine.
* Continue the iteration as long as the values are equal, if they aren't, return false.
* When you exit the loop return true.
