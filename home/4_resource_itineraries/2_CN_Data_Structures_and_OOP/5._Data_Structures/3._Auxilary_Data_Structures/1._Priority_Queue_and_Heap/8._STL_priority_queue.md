# 8. STL priority queue
Created Sunday 16 February 2020


* The priority_queue is actually a max priority queue.
* The only difference is in the remove and insert functions, i.e < becomes > and vice-versa, i.e sifting condition.
* void ``pop``() to ``remove``(), ``push``() to insert.
* p.``empty``() - returns true if empty.
* p.``top``() - returns root of the heap.
* p.``size``() - returns the size.
* priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> for min priority queue.
* **No need to include<vector>, as queue has it already.**
* By **default**, the **functor** is ``less<int>``.
* By **default**, priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int>>
* We will see the details afterwards.

```c++
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> min_pq;
priority_queue<int> max_pq;
```
