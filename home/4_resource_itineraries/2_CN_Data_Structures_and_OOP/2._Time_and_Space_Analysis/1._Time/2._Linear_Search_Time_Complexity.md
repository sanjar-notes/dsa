# 2. Linear Search Time Complexity
Created Sunday 05 January 2020

For linear search we have 3 cases:

1. Best case - constant. Key matches the first element.
2. Average case - something in between.
3. Worst case - Not present in the array or present at the last place. Time O(n). 


* Worst case is what we are interested in - so O(n) is can be called "Time Complexity of the Linear search".
