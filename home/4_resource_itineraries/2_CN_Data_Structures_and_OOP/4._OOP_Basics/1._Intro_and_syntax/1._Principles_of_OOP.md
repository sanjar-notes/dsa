# 1. Principles of OOP
Created Wednesday 08 January 2020

#### What is OOP
* OOP is just a programming paradigm.
* OOP solves some major problems that arise in procedural programming.
* As OOP is a reaction to the procedural style, its principles are nothing but solutions.


#### Principles of OOP
There are 4:

1. **Encapsulation** - practice of combining variables(data) and relevant functions into a single unit. 
	* Solution - Minimizes parameters, consequently minimizing arguments.
	* Context in C++ - *class*
2. **Abstraction** - process of hiding parts of the program for maintainability purposes.
	* Solution - Simplifies the interface. Reduces the impact of change, i.e we can have a complex and flexible web of helper functions, but the interface remains the same. 
	* Context in C++ - Access control, viz *public*, *private* and *protected*, enforce 'data hiding', which is the 'tool' used to achieve abstraction.
3. **Inheritance**
	* Solution - Eliminates redundant code.
	* Context in C++ - Parent class are specified when defining a class, using the ':' symbol.
4. **Polymorphism**
	* Solution - Eliminates if/else and switch statements. Code context based functions.
	* Context in C++ - The compiler chooses the relevant version of the function. We don't have to specify while calling.


#### Visibility - Abstraction
Visibility(access of members using object) is controlled using three keywords:

1. Public
2. Private
3. Protected
