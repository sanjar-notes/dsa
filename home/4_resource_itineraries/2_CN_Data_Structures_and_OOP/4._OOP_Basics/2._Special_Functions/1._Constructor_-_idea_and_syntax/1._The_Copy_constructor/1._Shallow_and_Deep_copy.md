# 1. Shallow and Deep copy
Created Friday 10 January 2020

Shallow vs deep copy?

* Shallow copy refers to the default copying scenario, which is bit by bit in C++.
* Deep copy means copying the contents of the object. Obviously, what is copied deeply is decided by the programmer.


### Need for deep copy

* For primitive types, shallow copy is okay. But if an object stores pointer to a data structure, and we just copy the pointer(without creating a copy of the data structure), then both objects will refer to the same place in memory when reading/writing to the data structure.
* This is **not good**, as we actually a clone.


### Context

* Both copy constructor and copy assignment operator do shallow copy.
* Hence we **need** to overload **both** the copy constructor and copy assignement operator if we wish to perform deep copy.


Example - A dynamic array. Assume extra code is present wherever necessary.
```c++
class DynamicArray
{
	int size, capacity;
	int * arr;
	...

	DynamicArray(const& A) // deep copy
	{
		size = A.size, capacity = A.capacity;
		arr = new int[capacity]; // allocate new memory
		for(int i=0; i<size; i++)
			arr[i] = A.arr[i];
	}

	void operator=(const& B) // A = B
	{
		size = B.size, capacity = B.capacity;
		delete[] arr; // delete current memory
		arr = new int[capacity];
		for(int i=0; i<size; i++)
			arr[i] = A.arr[i];
	}
}
```
