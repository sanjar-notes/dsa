# 2. Pointer Arithmetic
Created Saturday 21 December 2019

Addition and subtraction of integers is allowed on pointer variables(except **null** and **void** pointers). Other arithmetic operations such as multiplication and division are not allowed.
**Reason:** As we don't know the memory they reference and the jump, respectively, void* are increased by 1 in some compilers, but this is not a standard, it is done only if the ``-pedantic`` flag is used.

* When we do +2 for a pointer, we actually do start_address + 2*sizeof(data_type) . Similarly for subtraction.
* Variables declared together need not be contiguos. Memory is actually allocated as per availability.
* Array elements are always contiguos - definition of array.
* Each +-1 adds/subtracts by the sizeof(data_type).
* Everthing in pointer-land is about offsets, not about the addresses themselves.

Note: 

* Pointers may be **compared** by using relational operators, such as ==, <, and >. This meaningful only if p1 and p2 are **related** to each other, such as elements of the same array.
