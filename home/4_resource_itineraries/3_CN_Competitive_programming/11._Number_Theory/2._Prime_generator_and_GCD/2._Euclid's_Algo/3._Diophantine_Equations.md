# 3. Diophantine Equations

Created Wednesday 29 July 2020

Diohphantine Equations - These are polynomial equations for which integral solutions exist.

---

We need to study only about linear Diophantine equations.

- Solutions(integral) exist for this if gcd(a,b) is a factor of C.
- We are not going to prove this, but the intuition is easy:
  1.  gcd(a,b) is a factor of a, b
  2.  gcd(a, b) will divide ax+by
  3.  We represent this by c.

e.g ![](/assets/3._Diophantine_Equations-image-2.png) has solutions, while ![](/assets/3._Diophantine_Equations-image-3.png) has no integral solutions.

- We are studying this in order to apply extended Euclidean algorithm.
