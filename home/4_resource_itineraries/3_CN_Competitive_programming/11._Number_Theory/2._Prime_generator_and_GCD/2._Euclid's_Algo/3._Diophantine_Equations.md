# 3. Diophantine Equations
Created Wednesday 29 July 2020

Diohphantine Equations - These are polynomial equations for which integral solutions exist.

*****

We need to study only about linear Diophantine equations.

* Solutions(integral) exist for this if gcd(a,b) is a factor of C.
* We are not going to prove this, but the intuition is easy:
	1. gcd(a,b) is a factor of a, b
	2. gcd(a, b) will divide ax+by
	3. We represent this by c.

e.g ![](3._Diophantine_Equations/equation001.png) has solutions, while ![](3._Diophantine_Equations/equation002.png) has no integral solutions.

* We are studying this in order to apply extended Euclidean algorithm.
