# 2. Building a segment tree

Created Saturday 25 July 2020

- We make an implicit tree, like heap.
- Total elements = 2N-1 check this mathematically.
- We take an array of size 2N, where index 0 is unused, and the 0-N _sum_ is stored at index 1. Children of a node are stored at 2*r and 2*r+1.
- Build tree - O(N)
- Before building, decide what the segment tree will store, i.e _sum_, _product_ etc.
