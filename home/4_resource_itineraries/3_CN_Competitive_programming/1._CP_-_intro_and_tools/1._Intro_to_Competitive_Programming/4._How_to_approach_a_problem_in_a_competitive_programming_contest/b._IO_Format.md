# b. IO Format
Created Thursday 23 April 2020

Input:

* We can be given a single problem instance.
* We can be given test cases. Two approaches are possible here:


1. Output is displayed **after** all input case are over - Here we need to **store the input**. We will iterate on the inputs and display afterwards, no need of **output** storage.
	* Snippets stored in vscode C++, snippets. One for array input one for single data input.
2. Output displayed just after each case: No need to store the the ip's. Iterate and call the functions.

Here we need to write a function to do our job. i.e effectively we made it a functional problem.

Output: Don't write stuff like "Enter number" etc. The output should match exactly.
