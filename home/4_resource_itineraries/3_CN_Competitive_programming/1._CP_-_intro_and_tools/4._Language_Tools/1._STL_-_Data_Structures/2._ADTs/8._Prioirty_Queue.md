# 8. Prioirty Queue
Created Sunday 03 May 2020


* max heap - priority_queue



* The priority_queue is actually a max priority queue.
* The only difference is in the remove and insert functions, i.e < becomes > and vice-versa, i.e sifting condition.
* priority_queue<int, **vector<int>, greater<int>**> for min hep.
* **No need to include<vector>, as queue has it already.**
* By **default**, the **functor** is less<int>.
* By **default**, priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int>>
* We will see the details afterwards.
