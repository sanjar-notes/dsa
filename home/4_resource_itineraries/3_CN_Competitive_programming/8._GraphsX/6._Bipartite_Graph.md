Question: Given a graph, check whether it is bipartite or not?


* A useful property of a bipartite graph - A graph is bipartite iff it has no odd lengthed cycle. 

Proof: A graph = tree with cycles. Trees are always bipartite. The only thing left are cycles. A cycle is never bipartite, so a graph with cycle is never bipartite. And a graph with no cycle(a tree) is always bipartite.

Algorithm:

1. Do DFS and put vertices in a queue
2. Put a vertex in set1, and try to put all it's neigbours in set2.
