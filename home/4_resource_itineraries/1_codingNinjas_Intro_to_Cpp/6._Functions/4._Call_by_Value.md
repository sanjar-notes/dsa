# 4. Call by Value
Created Saturday 09 November 2019
Just another name for **pass by value**.

* This is a concept in Computer Science, where parameters are given a copy(value) of the argument, rather than giving them the memory location of the variable passed in the function call. 
* So the param and the argument, both, remain independent.
