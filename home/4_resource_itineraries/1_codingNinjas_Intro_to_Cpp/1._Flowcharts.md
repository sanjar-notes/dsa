How to solve a problem?
A:

1. Analyze the problem. Restatement is a part of this if possible/feasible.
2. Break down the problem into smaller steps.
3. Write down the solution on paper.
4. Verify the solution, using random examples. If you get stuck change the solution. 
5. Write code, this is just a formality.

**Done.**
