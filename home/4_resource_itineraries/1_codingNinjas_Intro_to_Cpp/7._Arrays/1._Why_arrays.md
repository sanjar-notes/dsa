# 1. Why arrays
Created Tuesday 12 November 2019

*Problem/Premise*: When we want to save data for working on it, it beomes tedious if a large number of variables are involved, agreed.
*Observations*: 

* It may be necessary if all are different. 
* But it is stupid if all of them are similar, or if we took all of them as input(e.g maximum among n elements). 

*Solution*: The solution to this, in the *simplest* way, is an array(a primary data structure), which is a contiguous space of the variable which are identified by an index. So it's easy and intuitive.

Declaration:
data_type name_of_the_array[size_required]
Initialization:

* At declaration, becomes easier as Cpp develops.
* By using a loop.


**Confidence Increased!!**
