# 3. Arrays and memory
Created Tuesday 12 November 2019


* Zero Indexing is preferred, coz it decreases an operation on the CPU(Really) 
* Hence index is the same as "distance from the first element".
* Address  = root addrress + (size_of_datatype)*index
* Except for strings, couting arr_name returns the root address. For a char array, it looks for a '\0' and hence prints the string.


**You were right, there's no way that we pass an array as arg without it's size. We need to explictly pass the size, as the head is merely a pointer.**

* When we write paramaters, we write (data_type name[]), although data_type* name would have worked too.
* But when we call the function, we pass only the array name.
