# 4. How is the data stored

How are float stored?
For the decimal equivalent, we store the mantissa and the corresponding exponent.
**Typecasting:**

* The least significant bytes are just copied to the memory location. This is observable when the new type is of lesser size than the original variable.

e.g1 int x = 19920; char p = x; // the compiler will just copy the last byte of the integer as the value of the char. 
e.g2 char a = 'c'; int x = a; // here the byte for the char is copied as the least significant byte of the integer. The remaining 3 bytes in the left are kept zero.   

* float to int, here the decimal is **dropped(truncated)**, whether it be positive or negative.
