# 6. cin vs cin.get()
Created Tuesday 22 October 2019


* **cin **ignores space, tabs and enter(newline).
* cin.get() accepts spaces. Just write x = cin.get()

It accepts spaces, tabs and newlines. 
How does cin or cin.get operate, they keep on taking values until we give the enter command.

This is a very good and easy page to cin and cout for C++
