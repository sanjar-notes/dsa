* keyword is for. **And not for each.**
* Also called range based <loops.http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/control/>
* This loop is automatic and does not require the explicit initialization of any counter variable.
* Syntax: for(data_type variable_name: collection_name)

{

}

* Ranges are sequences of elements, including arrays, containers, and any other type supporting the functions begin and end; i.e works only on collections, i.e arrays, strings or vectors.
* Range based loops usually also make use of type deduction for the type of the elements with auto.
