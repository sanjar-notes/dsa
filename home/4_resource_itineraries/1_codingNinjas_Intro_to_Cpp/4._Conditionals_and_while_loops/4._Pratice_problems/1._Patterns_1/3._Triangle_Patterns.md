# 3. Triangle Patterns
Created Friday 18 October 2019

Just solve for the 3 questions.
Beware of the spaces.
For the given pattern, for n = 4.
1
2 3
3 4 5
4 5 6 7
Q1) no. of rows  = N
Q2) no. of columns = i
Q3) What to print, there are **two** methods here, either formulate an epression for (i,j) or just start with i and print i terms.
Here, I'll use the latter because it's obvious and easy to code. Here the val will be **initialized** to i, after every newline.  

in this question,
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10.
Here Q1 and Q2 are same. We can either cout i + j, or just declare a variable k, and keep track of it till the end of the program.
