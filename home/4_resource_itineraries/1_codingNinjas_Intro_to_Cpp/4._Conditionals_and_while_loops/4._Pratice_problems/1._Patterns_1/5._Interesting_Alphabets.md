Answer: q1) Number of rows = n, i from 1 to n
q2) no of columns = i.
q3) The nth alphabet, followed by the successors.
We need to keep track of the first letter of each row, one way can be to store only the 1st letter as a calculation, an and the rest as code.
char val = 'A'+n-1; // gives the nth alphabet
then we do val-- for each row. We also need a second variable for the row elements.
