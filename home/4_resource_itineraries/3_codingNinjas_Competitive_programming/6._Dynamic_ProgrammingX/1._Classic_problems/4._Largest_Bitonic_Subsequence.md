# 4. Largest Bitonic Subsequence
Created Wednesday 01 July 2020

**Largest Bitonic Subsequence**
You are given an array of positive integers as input. Write a code to return the length of the largest such subsequence in which the values are arranged first in strictly ascending order and then in strictly descending order.

Such a subsequence is known as bitonic subsequence. A purely increasing or purely decreasing subsequence will also be considered as a bitonic sequence with the other part empty.

Note that the elements in bitonic subsequence need not be consecutive in the given array but the order should remain same.
**Input Format:**
Line 1 : A positive Integer N, i.e., the size of array
Line 2 : N space-separated integers as elements of the array 
**Output Format:**
Length of Largest Bitonic subsequence
**Input Constraints:**
1<= N <= 100000
**Sample Input 1:**
6
15 20 20 6 4 2
**Sample Output 1:**
5
**Sample Output 1 Explanation:**
Here, longest Bitonic subsequence is {15, 20, 6, 4, 2} which has length = 5.
//Sample Input 2://
2
1 5
**Sample Output 2:**
2
**Sample Input 3:**
2
5 1
**Sample Output 3:**
2

*****


* This is like the longest increasing subsequence.
* We basically maintain two values, longest increasing subsequence ending at i. Longest decreasing subsequence starting from i.
* We add the pair-values and pick the maximum.
* We need to subtract one, as the topmost point was calculated for both the increasing and the decreasing part of the bitonic subarry.
