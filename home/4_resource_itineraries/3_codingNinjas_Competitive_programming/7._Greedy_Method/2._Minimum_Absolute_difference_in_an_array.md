# 2. Minimum Absolute difference in an array
Created Sunday 19 July 2020


* Sort the array. Now consecutive difference is the minimum difference if any.
* This creates an optimal substructure - going all the way from left to right.
* Greedy works out - minimum is the minimum consecutive difference.
