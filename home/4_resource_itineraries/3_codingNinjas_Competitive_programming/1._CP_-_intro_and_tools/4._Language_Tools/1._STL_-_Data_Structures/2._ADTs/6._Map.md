# 6. Map
Created Sunday 03 May 2020


* Stores key value pairs.
* Uses hashing.
* mapn.insert(key, value)
* = does deep copy
* To check do .find(value) or .count(value)
* We can use man[key] = value can be used for insertion as well as retrieval.
* .at(key) is the same as mapn[key].
* When using the iterator, element->first is the key, element->second->is the value. **Iterator points to the whole element block, not just the key or value.**

* map is made using BST - logn
* unordered map is made using hashtable - O(1) for all ops.
* map supports 'pair' while unordered_map does not support it.
