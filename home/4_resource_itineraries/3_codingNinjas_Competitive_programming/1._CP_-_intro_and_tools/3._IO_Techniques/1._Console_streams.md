* In general, cin cout streams are **slow** in programing contests.
* To get faster IO use the C methods **printf** and **scanf**.
* Or you may **put this** statement before any cin or cout statement.
```c++
ios::sync_with_stdio (false);
```
 • This statement turns off the synchronization between the C++ IO and C IO, so once you use it you **can’t use** printf and scanf.
