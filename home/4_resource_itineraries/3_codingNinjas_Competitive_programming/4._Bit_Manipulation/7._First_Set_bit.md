# 7. First Set bit
Created Tuesday 30 June 2020


* Find the first set bit and return it with the LSB's

e.g 101010**1**00 â‡’ **1**00

We don't now where the first 1 is, do manips, and we don't
```c++
n =    101010100
n-1;// 101010011 // useless
-n; // 010101101
n & -n
```

* n & n-1


*****

Turn off first set bit
```c++
n =    101010100
n-1;// 101010011
n & (n-1);// nothing was affected on the left
```
