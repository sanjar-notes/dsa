# 1. Modulo Arithmetic
Created Monday 22 June 2020

**Modular arithmetic** is a **system of arithmeti**c for __integers__, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder.


* An intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.
* Remainders are always whole numbers. Very important.

15 mod(9) = 6
(-15) mod 9 = 3

Applications of the % operator:

1. To avoid overflow.

e.g long long is 8 bytes, i.e 2^63^-1 is the maximum number it can store. 

* If our answer is 2^32 ^* 2^40^, it cannot be stored even in long long. 
* To verify the solution, we use the modulo operator to avoid, and hence get a mapping which we can represent. 
* The modulo is generally taken w.r.t to a number which is:
	1. Very large  - so that there are many mappings, available.
	2. It is prime, so that distribution is uniform.
* Mostly 10^9^+7 is taken, as it satisfies both the criteria(big and prime).
