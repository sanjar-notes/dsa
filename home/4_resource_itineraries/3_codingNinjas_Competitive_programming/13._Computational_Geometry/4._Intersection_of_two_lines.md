# 4. Intersection of two lines
Created Thursday 20 August 2020

**Intersection of lines**

* We are given 2 pairs of points, which lie on one line each.
* Do they intersect. Represent them as lines. If det()=0, then they are parallel.


**Intersection of line segments**

* Check if the intersect.
* Check if intersecting point lies using this

if min(x~1~, x~2~)≤ x ≤ max(x~1~, x~2~) and min(y~1~, y~2~)≤ y ≤ min(y~1~, y~2~)
