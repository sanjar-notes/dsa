# 1. Intro to Computational Geometry
Created Thursday 20 August 2020


* We use elementary geometry to solve problems here.
* Vector concepts are used here, like products(dot and cross), magnitudes, displacement etc.
* Dot product (x~1~, y~1~), (x~2~, y~2~) = x~1~x~2~+y~1~y~2~ = |a|*|b|*cos(Î¸)
* Cross product - Area of triangle(AxB/2), Area of parallelogram(AxB)
