# 4. Circular List of students
Created Tuesday 30 June 2020

**Circular List of Students:**
You are given a circular list of students as follows:
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11
This list is circular, means that 11 will follow 0 again. You will be given the student number ‘i’ and some position ‘p’. You will have to tell that if the list will start from (i+1)th student, then which student will be at pth position.
**Input Format:**
First line will have an integer ‘t’, denoting the number of test cases.
Next line will have two space separated integers denoting the value of ‘i’ and ‘p’ respectively.
**Output Format:**
Print ‘t’ lines containing single integer denoting the student number.
**Constraints:**
1 <= t <= 10^5
0 <= i <= 11
1 <= p <= 12
**Sample Input:**
2
2 3
5 8
**Sample Output:**
5
1
**Explanation:**
First, list will start at 3. 3 -> 4 -> 5. Hence, 5 will be at third position.
Second, list will start at 6. 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 0 -> 1. Hence, 1 will be at 8th position.
