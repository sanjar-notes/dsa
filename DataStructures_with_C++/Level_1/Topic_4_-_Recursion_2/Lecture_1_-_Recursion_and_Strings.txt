====== Lecture 1 - Recursion and Strings ======
Created Thursday 02 January 2020

Some basic problems on strings using recursion:
1. Length of the string. Just do a head recursion. return 1 + length(input+1). Base case is the null character.
2. RemoveX(), we need to remove all 'x's in the given string.
	a. Shift by 1, that is O(n^{2}) time. Memory O(1).
	b. Pass the write head, time O(n). Memory O(n) [Assuming we don't use pointers]. Or O(1) if references in the symbol table take constant space.
3. Remove duplicates, same as 2 except, that we do if(arr[0]==arr[1]) instead of if(arr[0]==x).
