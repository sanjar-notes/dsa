====== Lecture 3 - Fibonacci Number ======
Created Saturday 28 December 2019

* An extended, or obvious extension of PMI is to assume that f(k) is true for all values i<=k.(i.e if step 2 holds for all the The other steps stay the same)
* Number of jumps = Number of base case conditions. Because jumps are potentially unstoppable, hence we need to care of them.
* Solve any recursive problem:
	1. Solve the problem using extended PMI.
		Revision, how to do PMI.
			1. Find the base case(s).
			2. Propose a hypothesis, i.e the expression. Assume f(k-1) to be true. 
			3. Prove that it is true for a step k.
	2. Write the code.
	3. Dry run it using trees.
	4. Done!!
