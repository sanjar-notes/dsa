====== Lecture 7 - Inbuilt priority queue ======
Created Sunday 16 February 2020

* Inbuilt priority queue is used for heaps.
* Present in STL in C++
* Required header: #include<queue>
* class name is ''priority_queue''
* It is a max_priority queue.
The interface(implemented using vector):
1. bool empty() - returns true if empty, else false
2. int size() - returns the current size of the queue
3. void push(data) - inserts a new node in the heap
4. top() - returns the maximum in the heap, same as getMax() 
5. void pop() - removes the maximum from the queue

Call the functions only within bounds.
