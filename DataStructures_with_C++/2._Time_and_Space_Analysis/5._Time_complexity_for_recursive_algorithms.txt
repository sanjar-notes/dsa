====== 5. Time complexity for recursive algorithms ======
Created Monday 06 January 2020

* For recursive algorithms, just write down the **recurrence relation, **//with the anchor condition//.
* Make the relation as compact as possible, by combining constants(whereever possible).
* Solve this to get the time complexity. 

**Methods for solving recurrence relations.**
* Write down all (...) the recursive 'levels', solve all these equations.(By adding/subtracting/manipulating them all). i.e 
	a. //Back substitution + MI to predict the exponents//.
	b. small work + recursion work.

--------------------
* Recurrence Tree, we guess our solutions using this. Proved using MI.
* Master's Theorem.
**Note**: 
* ceil and floor functions can be assumed to be integers for asymptotic notation.
* Also numbers may be assumed to be exact powers of 2(this is somehwat problematic).
* We can ignore the constants with degree terms.
