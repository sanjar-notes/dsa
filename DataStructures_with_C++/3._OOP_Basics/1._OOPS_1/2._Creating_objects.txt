====== 2. Creating objects ======
Created Wednesday 08 January 2020

=== Syntax ===
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
class_name object_name; // this allocates memory. variable of type student in the stack.
class_name * object_name = new class_name; 	// this creates a pointer in stack to a memory location in heap.
}}}

* This is **exactly **like we do for in-built data types.
* Memory allocated for an object = sum of the memory of the attributes. **No meta data is stored in the objects, viz functions, static variables.**

**Q**) Can we create an object anywhere we like?
**A**) We can create anywhere after the class has been defined.
* To include classes from other files, use this syntax.
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
#include "absolute_path/class_file_name.extnsn" // different directory
#include "file.extnsn" // file in the current directory
}}}

* #include just copies text from the //class_file_name.extnsn //to the current file.
--------------------

=== Accessing members of an object ===
* Variable
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
obj.name; // access 'name' attribute of 'obj' object
obj.fact() // call fact() function of 'obj'
// . is called the selector operator
}}}

* Pointer
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
(*p).name; 
(*p).fact();

// C++  has a better way, a simple expression. Does exactly the same thing.
p->name;
p->fact();
}}}

--------------------

=== **Concept of Access Specifier in C++** ===
* Access Specifiers are keywords associated with members(attributes, functions) which modify the level of access.
* They are applicable only outside the class, i.e they have no meaning inside the class.
* There are three: //public//, //private// and protected.
Syntax:
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
class A{
	public:
		int a;
		int b;
	private:
		void f();
};
}}}

* We can have multiple sections of the same specifier too.
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
class A{
	public:
		int a;
		int b;
	private:
		void f();
	public: //allowed
		int c;
};
}}}

**Notes: **
* When not specified, all things are **private **by default in a class.
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
class Car{
	int a; // a is private
};
}}}

* [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4117002/why-can-i-access-private-variables-in-the-copy-constructor|The access modifiers work on class level, and not on object level]] i.e, two objects of the same class can access each others private data.
